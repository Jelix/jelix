    * new command to test the mailer. To send an email to check mailer parameters, 
      execute `php console.php mailer:test my.email@example.com`
    * jForms: new control jControlTime, and support of a `<time>` element in jforms 
    * New method `jEvent::getParameters()`

* Fix web assets upgrader with jforms_datepicker and jforms_datetimepicker
* Fix web assets loading of the datetime widget
* Fix console: initialize a coordinator so components could work well
* Fix: some components should check if the coordinator is there or not 
* Authentication: `checkCookieToken()` does not trigger anymore a 500 error page
  if the cookie token is invalid.
* jAcl2: adapter system to make the glue to authentication.    
  It allows to use authentication library other than jAuth, like
  the jelix/authentication-module library.

  - dao method `jacl2rights::deleteByRole()` becomes `deleteByRight()`
  - dao method `jacl2rights::deleteByGroupAndRoles()` becomes `deleteByGroupAndRights()`
  - dao method `jacl2subject::findAllRoles()` becomes `findAllRights()`
  - dao method `jacl2subject::removeRolesFromGroup()` becomes `removeRightsFromRightsGroup()`
  - dao method `jacl2subject::replaceRoleGroup()` becomes `replaceRightsGroup()`
  - console command `acl2:role-create` becomes `acl2:right-create`
  - console command `acl2:role-delete` becomes `acl2:right-delete`
  - console command `acl2:role-group-create` becomes `acl2:rights-group-create`
