What is Jelix?
==============

Jelix is an open-source framework for PHP5.

It has a modular, extensible architecture. Applications based on Jelix are made with modules,
which allow to reuse features in several projects.

For more informations, read http://jelix.org/articles/en/features

Installation
============

Sources in the repository are not useable directly. You must "build" jelix.
But it's certainly better for you to download a package containing Jelix ready to use.
See [the download page](http://jelix.org/articles/en/download).

Jelix 1.5+ is compatible only with PHP 5.3 or more.

Read [the first chapter of the manual to install Jelix and to create an application](http://docs.jelix.org/en/manual-1.5/getting-started)
