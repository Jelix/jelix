What is Jelix?
==============

Jelix is an open-source framework for PHP. Jelix 1.6 is compatible from PHP 5.3 to PHP 8.1. 

It has a modular, extensible architecture. Applications based on Jelix are made with
modules, which allow to reuse features in several projects.

For more informations, read [details about its features](http://jelix.org/articles/en/features).

**Warning**: Jelix 1.6 is not maintained anymore. Please use the latest available maintained version. 

Installation
============

Sources in the repository are not usable directly. You must "build" jelix.
But it's certainly better for you to download a package containing Jelix ready to use.
See [the download page](http://jelix.org/articles/en/download).

Jelix 1.6 is compatible from PHP 5.3 to at least PHP 8.1.
